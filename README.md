# GCCD+

GCCD+ is an enhanced version of Generic Code Clone Detection (GCCD) tool for detecting code clones in Java-based applications using Bellon's benchmark dataset. GCCD is a code clone detection tool comprises of five main processes which are pre-process, transformation, parameterization, categorization and match detection process. This tool enable detection on code clone types are Type-1, Type-2, Type-3 and Type-4. GCCD+ focuses on enhancing the match detection process where Chi-square distance formula is implemented. The GCCD+ also focusing on enhancing the parameterization process where the protected weightage value is implemented in developing parameters for the clone detection.
